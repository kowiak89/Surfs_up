# Surfs_up

## Objective: 
The objective of this project was to analyze weather data captured by weather stations across the island of Oahu in order to determine the vaibility of a surf/ice cream shop.  Our data was sourced from hawaii.sqlite, and jupyter notebook was used to query the data.

## Results:
Durning this stage of the analysis, the main focus was dtermining if temperature at various times of the year would allow for our client's new shop to be open year round.  By analyzing data from the month of [June](link) and the month of [December](link), we captured the extremes of the weather data (peak summer and peak winter).  The following list is some of the major points from this analysis:
    
    * The weather stations captured about the same amount of measurements for each month (1700 for June and 1517 for December) indicating that we can comparing the data from these two months.
    * The mean temperatures were similar for both months, but there was more variability in the temperature in the month of December since it had a wider min-max gap.
    * December is a colder month, as shown by every stat in the images above, meaning that ice cream sales might be lower and thus a winter months stragtegy might need to be employed to keep sales the same.

## Summary:
From our analysis Oahu looks like a great place to open a surf/ice cream shop.  From the descriptive stats for each month we can see that the temperature remains fairly similar year round, but there is more variability in the winter months.  It would be wise to advertise more and even offer promotions for ice cream in the winter months to balance sales.

While temperature has an important impact on people inclination to go surfing there are also several other factors to take into account.  Wave size and consistency is a factor that should be looked in to, in order to get an better sense of wheather surfs sales will be consistent year round.  Perhaps the weather stations can deliver that data.

Another weather condtion to analyze is the amount of sunshine for each month.  People may be more inclined to go surfing or eat ice cream on sunny days rather than cloudy ones.  Knowing if there is a differnce in the number of sunny days between June and December would strengthen our confidence for consistent sales year round.
